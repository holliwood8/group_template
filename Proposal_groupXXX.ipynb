    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "Brain tumor segmentation is a long-standing challenge in the medical field: the development of accurate and efficient techniques to detect brain tumors from medical imaging such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) would make diagnosis more accessible and facilitate prompt treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, brain tumor segmentation has been based on simple yet effective threshold techniques, where an intensity value is selected as threshold, and voxels (3-dimensional pixels) with higher intensity are marked as tumor tissue<a name=\"threshold\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#threshold).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years the development of neural networks has improved the accuracy of MRI tumor detection. One well-performing family of architectures are Convolutional Neural Networks, in which an MRI image is convolved with several kernels, allowing for the detection of tumor-like features and ultimately the segmentation of the tumor itself<a name=\"CNN\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#CNN). Critically, CNNs must be trained on labeled data, hence they require the manual expert segmentation of brain tumors. Given that a large dataset is essential for optimal training, the need for manually segmented images represents a drawback of this architecture.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Even more accurate brain tumor segmentation is achieved though the SOTA technique of U-NETs, developed by Olaf Ronnenberg and colleagues in 2015 for medical imaging segmentation<a name=\"U-NET\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#U-NET). U-NET architectures harness an encoding path (for downsampling, similar to a CNN) and a decoding path (for upsampling, through successive convolutions and upsampling operations) to precisely localize tumors with limited datasets, which is revolutionary for the field and a leap from traditional CNNs<a name=\"3DU-NET\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#3DU-NET)."

    "\n",
    "This project is aimed at tackling the problem of automatic brain tumor semantic segmentation from medical imaging. More specifically, given a high-resolution (1x1x1mm) MRI image of the brain, we aim at identifying each and all the voxels that belong to the tumor, assigning them a label of 1 (tumor) or 0 (non-tumor). This task is relevant to machine-learning, as it involves clustering algorithms and neural-network-based solutions."
